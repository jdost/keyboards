# TMK configs

I own a few keyboards that use the TMK firmware.  This is the collection of my 
modifications and keymaps for these keyboards.  Look in each directory to get some
details about changes made and how to utilize them yourself.

## build script

The build script is just a simple script I use to try and make building a firmware
a one line action.  I run this script via an exec call into an LXC container so that
I can isolate the various requirements from my main OS.
